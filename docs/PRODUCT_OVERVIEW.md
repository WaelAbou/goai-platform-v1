# SustainData AI

### Intelligent Carbon Tracking & ESG Reporting Platform

---

## The Challenge

Every sustainability leader faces the same obstacles:

- 📄 **Manual Data Collection** — Hours spent gathering utility bills, travel receipts, and supplier reports
- 📊 **Scattered Information** — Data lives in emails, spreadsheets, and filing cabinets
- ⏰ **Slow Reporting Cycles** — Weeks to compile quarterly ESG reports
- ❓ **Compliance Uncertainty** — Keeping up with evolving regulations (GRI, TCFD, SBTi)
- 🔢 **Calculation Errors** — Manual CO₂e calculations prone to mistakes

---

## The Solution

**SustainData AI** transforms sustainability management through intelligent automation.

Simply upload any document — utility bills, flight receipts, shipping invoices — and our AI instantly extracts the data, calculates emissions, and updates your carbon footprint in real-time.

> *"From document to dashboard in seconds, not days."*
