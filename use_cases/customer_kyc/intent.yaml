  # Problem statement
  problem: |
    Manual KYC verification is time-consuming (15-30 minutes per customer),
    error-prone, and creates bottlenecks in customer onboarding.
    Compliance officers need to verify identity documents, assess risk levels,
    and ensure regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions.
    
  # Solution
  solution: |
    AI-powered KYC system that:
    1. Extracts and validates information from ID documents
    2. Performs risk assessment based on customer data
    3. Checks against compliance rules and watchlists
    4. Generates verification reports with confidence scores
    5. Flags high-risk cases for human review
