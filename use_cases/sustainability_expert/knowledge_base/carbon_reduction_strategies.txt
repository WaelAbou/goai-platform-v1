# Carbon Reduction Strategies
## Practical Guide for Businesses

## Quick Wins (0-6 months, Low Cost)

### Energy Efficiency
1. **LED Lighting Upgrade**
   - Reduction: 50-70% of lighting energy
   - ROI: 2-3 years
   - Implementation: Replace all bulbs, add motion sensors

2. **HVAC Optimization**
   - Reduction: 10-30% of heating/cooling
   - Actions: Smart thermostats, schedule optimization, regular maintenance
   
3. **Equipment Power Management**
   - Reduction: 5-15% of office energy
   - Actions: Auto-sleep settings, smart power strips, virtualization

### Behavioral Changes
1. Remote work policies (15-20% commute reduction)
2. Video conferencing vs. travel (up to 90% per meeting)
3. Print reduction initiatives (5-10% energy savings)

## Medium-Term Actions (6-24 months, Medium Investment)

### Renewable Energy Transition
1. **On-site Solar**
   - Potential: 20-100% of facility electricity
   - ROI: 5-10 years
   - Incentives: Tax credits, accelerated depreciation

2. **Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)**
   - Lock in renewable energy prices for 10-20 years
   - No capital investment required
   - Additionality: Supports new renewable projects

3. **Green Tariffs**
   - Switch utility provider to renewable option
   - Implementation: Immediate
   - Premium: 5-15% additional cost

### Fleet Electrification
- Replace ICE vehicles with EVs
- Install charging infrastructure
- Average reduction: 50-70% per vehicle

### Supply Chain Engagement
1. Supplier sustainability requirements
2. Sustainable procurement policies
3. Local sourcing to reduce transport

## Long-Term Transformations (2-10 years, Major Investment)

### Building Decarbonization
1. **Electrification of Heating**
   - Heat pumps vs. gas boilers
   - Reduction: 60-80%
   - Cost: $10,000-50,000 per system

2. **Building Retrofits**
   - Insulation, windows, building envelope
   - Reduction: 30-50% of HVAC load

3. **Net-Zero Buildings**
   - LEED Platinum / BREEAM Outstanding
   - On-site generation + efficiency

### Process Innovation
1. Low-carbon manufacturing processes
2. Circular economy models
3. Material substitution

## Carbon Offsetting (Last Resort)

### Quality Criteria
1. Additionality - wouldn't happen without the credit
2. Permanence - long-term carbon storage
3. Verification - third-party certified
4. No leakage - doesn't shift emissions elsewhere

### Reputable Standards
- Gold Standard
- Verra (VCS)
- American Carbon Registry
- Climate Action Reserve

### Price Range
- Basic offsets: $5-15/tonne
- High-quality nature-based: $15-50/tonne
- Direct air capture: $200-600/tonne

## Measurement & Reporting

### Key Metrics
1. Total emissions (tCO2e)
2. Carbon intensity (tCO2e/$M revenue)
3. Per-employee emissions
4. Scope-specific reductions
5. Renewable energy percentage

### Reporting Frameworks
- GRI Standards
- CDP Climate Change
- TCFD Recommendations
- GHG Protocol

## Industry-Specific Strategies

### Technology/SaaS
- Cloud optimization (right-sizing, spot instances)
- Green cloud providers (Google, Azure renewable regions)
- Sustainable hardware lifecycle

### Manufacturing
- Process efficiency
- Waste heat recovery
- Electrification of processes

### Retail
- Store efficiency programs
- Sustainable packaging
- Last-mile delivery optimization

### Finance
- Green building standards for branches
- Sustainable investment policies
- Financed emissions reduction
