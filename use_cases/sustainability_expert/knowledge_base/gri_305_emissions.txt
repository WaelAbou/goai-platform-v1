# GRI 305: Emissions 2016

## Overview
GRI 305 sets out reporting requirements on emissions to air. This Standard addresses three scopes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and two types of significant air emissions.

## Scope 1: Direct GHG Emissions
Direct GHG emissions occur from sources owned or controlled by the organization. Examples include:
- Emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles
- Emissions from chemical production in owned or controlled process equipment
- Company facilities (manufacturing plants, offices)
- Company vehicles (fleet cars, trucks, aircraft)

Calculation Method:
GHG emissions = Activity data × Emission factor × GWP

## Scope 2: Indirect GHG Emissions (Energy)
Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased energy consumed by the organization. This includes:
- Purchased electricity
- Purchased steam
- Purchased heating
- Purchased cooling

Two methods for reporting:
1. Location-based method: Uses average emission factors for the grid
2. Market-based method: Uses supplier-specific emission factors

## Scope 3: Other Indirect GHG Emissions
All other indirect GHG emissions that occur in the value chain, including:
- Upstream: Purchased goods, transportation, waste, business travel, employee commuting
- Downstream: Distribution, use of sold products, end-of-life treatment

## Key Metrics
- 305-1: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions
- 305-2: Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions
- 305-3: Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions
- 305-4: GHG emissions intensity
- 305-5: Reduction of GHG emissions
- 305-6: Emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODS)
- 305-7: Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and other significant air emissions

## Reporting Requirements
Organizations shall report:
- Gross direct GHG emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent
- Gases included in the calculation (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3)
- Biogenic CO2 emissions separately
- Base year for calculation and rationale
- Source of emission factors and GWP values
- Consolidation approach (equity share or operational control)

## Standards for Emission Factors
- IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
- EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories
- UK DEFRA Conversion Factors

## Best Practices
1. Set science-based targets aligned with 1.5°C pathway
2. Report using both location-based and market-based methods
3. Include Scope 3 emissions for complete picture
4. Get third-party verification for material emissions
5. Disclose methodology and assumptions
