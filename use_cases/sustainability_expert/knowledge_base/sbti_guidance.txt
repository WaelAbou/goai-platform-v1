# Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)
## Setting Corporate Emissions Reduction Targets

## What are Science-Based Targets?
Science-based targets are greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets that are in line with what the latest climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement – to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

## Why Set Science-Based Targets?
1. Future-proof growth - stay ahead of regulations
2. Boost investor confidence - attract sustainable investment
3. Drive innovation - spark new product development
4. Strengthen credibility - demonstrate climate leadership
5. Save money - reduce energy costs through efficiency

## Target Setting Methods

### 1. Absolute Contraction Approach
Reduces absolute emissions by a fixed percentage annually.
- Suitable for: All companies
- Minimum ambition: 4.2% annual reduction for 1.5°C alignment

### 2. Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA)
Based on sector-specific pathways allocating global carbon budget.
- Suitable for: Homogeneous sectors
- Considers sector growth projections

### 3. Economic Intensity Approach
Reduces emissions per unit of economic output.
- Less commonly used
- Requires minimum absolute reduction

## Scope Requirements

### Near-Term Targets (5-10 years)
- Scope 1 and 2: REQUIRED for all companies
- Scope 3: Required if >40% of total emissions
- Minimum ambition: 1.5°C aligned (4.2% annual reduction)

### Long-Term Targets (2050)
- Net-zero commitment
- Covers all scopes
- Requires 90% absolute reduction
- Maximum 10% neutralization via carbon removal

## Validation Process

1. **Commit**: Submit commitment letter to SBTi
2. **Develop**: Create targets (24 months to submit)
3. **Submit**: Send targets for validation
4. **Communicate**: Announce validated targets
5. **Disclose**: Report annually on progress

## Target Criteria

For 1.5°C Alignment:
- Scope 1+2: 4.2% linear annual reduction (minimum)
- Scope 3: 2.5% linear annual reduction (minimum)
- Base year: No earlier than 2015
- Timeframe: 5-10 years from submission

## Scope 3 Categories to Include
When Scope 3 is >40% of total emissions, include:
- Purchased goods and services
- Capital goods
- Business travel
- Employee commuting
- Upstream transportation
- Downstream transportation
- Use of sold products
- End-of-life treatment

## Industry Examples

### Technology Sector
- Apple: Carbon neutral by 2030
- Microsoft: Carbon negative by 2030
- Google: 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030

### Manufacturing
- Siemens: Carbon neutral operations by 2030
- Unilever: Net zero by 2039

### Finance
- HSBC: Net zero financed emissions by 2050
- JPMorgan: Net zero by 2050

## Best Practices
1. Start with comprehensive GHG inventory
2. Engage suppliers on Scope 3
3. Set interim milestones
4. Link targets to executive compensation
5. Report progress transparently
6. Review and update targets as science evolves
