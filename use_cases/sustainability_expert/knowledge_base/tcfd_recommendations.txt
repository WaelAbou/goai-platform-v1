# TCFD Recommendations
## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

## Overview
The TCFD was established by the Financial Stability Board to develop voluntary, consistent climate-related financial disclosures for companies to provide information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders.

## Four Core Elements

### 1. Governance
Disclose the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.

Recommended Disclosures:
a) Board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities
b) Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities

Key Questions:
- Does the board oversee climate-related issues?
- How often is the board informed about climate issues?
- Who is responsible for climate matters at management level?

### 2. Strategy
Disclose actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.

Recommended Disclosures:
a) Climate-related risks and opportunities identified over short, medium, and long term
b) Impact on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning
c) Resilience of strategy under different climate scenarios (including 2°C or lower)

Time Horizons:
- Short-term: 0-1 years
- Medium-term: 1-5 years
- Long-term: 5-30 years

### 3. Risk Management
Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.

Recommended Disclosures:
a) Processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks
b) Processes for managing climate-related risks
c) Integration into overall risk management

Risk Categories:
- Physical Risks: Acute (extreme weather) and Chronic (sea level rise, temperature changes)
- Transition Risks: Policy, Legal, Technology, Market, Reputation

### 4. Metrics and Targets
Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunities.

Recommended Disclosures:
a) Metrics used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities
b) Scope 1, Scope 2, and (if appropriate) Scope 3 GHG emissions
c) Targets used to manage climate-related risks and opportunities

Key Metrics:
- GHG emissions (all three scopes)
- Carbon intensity ratios
- Water usage
- Energy usage and mix
- Revenue from low-carbon products

## Scenario Analysis
Organizations should describe the resilience of their strategy under different scenarios:

1. Paris-aligned scenario (1.5°C - 2°C)
2. Current policies scenario (3°C+)
3. Delayed transition scenario

## Implementation Guidance
1. Start with governance structure
2. Integrate climate into enterprise risk management
3. Conduct scenario analysis
4. Set measurable targets
5. Report annually with improving disclosure quality

## Sector-Specific Guidance
TCFD provides supplemental guidance for:
- Financial Sector (Banks, Insurance, Asset Owners, Asset Managers)
- Non-Financial Sectors (Energy, Transportation, Materials & Buildings, Agriculture, Food, Forest Products)
